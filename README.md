This is an aplication focused on learning CPP and with hopes to be a full fledge image editor (ish).

## Preview
To the date (July 2025) the program looks like this.


# TODOS
* Highlights and Shadows uses luminance values obtained from [this post in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/596216/formula-to-determine-perceived-brightness-of-rgb-color/13558570#13558570). Verify correctness of this.
* GUI is a work in progress. Learning ImGUi as the development continues.
* Probably is a good idea to create a log system. 
    *   in that regard, change errors to be visible in the gui rather than the console. (popus? alerts?)
* To implement HSL and HSV [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).
